- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Spectrazz or Nicoli, I am 14 years old and I am really interested in learning programming and I have known this social network for some time, I forgot that I had created an account here a few years ago, and when I remembered I decided to come back out of interest in the community :)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming and games, I'm an '' initial '' programmer, because I'm at the beginning of the study, so I guess I can't use the initial programmer for me right now
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning logistic course and learning programming through youtube tutorials lol
- ðŸ“« How to reach me; Spectra#9954 so, I am currently using discord to communicate with others
